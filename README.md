## Mandible width to body length:

This plot present larval mandible width vs.Â body length, with key
benchmarks noted:

    ## [1] "Soldier pupa mean body length is 4415.2576 uM"

    ## [1] "Worker pupa mean body length is 3651.85539534884 uM"

    ## [1] "Queen pupa mean body length is 6338.89 uM"

    ## [1] "Male pupa mean body length is 4647.183 uM"

    ## [1] "The mean prepupal head width is 217.2765625 uM"

Note that three larvae from MEBLHPR4831 are currently developing into
queens (I think) and have been measured on 9/27, 10/02, and 10/13.
